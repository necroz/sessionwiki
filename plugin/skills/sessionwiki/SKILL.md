name: sessionwiki
description: Search the user's sessionwiki (a wiki compiled from their past Claude Code, Codex, Cursor and other AI coding sessions) through the sessionwiki MCP tools. Use before a task that may depend on earlier decisions or existing solutions, and when the user asks about their own past work — "what did I decide about X", "how did I fix Y last time", "have I done this before", "what was I working on in project Z".

# sessionwiki

The `sessionwiki` MCP server reads a local wiki built from the user's past agent
sessions. Search it before you redo work that may already be solved.

## When to search

- Before a task in a project the user worked on before: look for earlier
  decisions, rejected approaches and known pitfalls.
- When the user asks about their own history, preferences or past fixes.
- Do not search for general knowledge ("how does TCP work").

## Tools

| Tool | Use it to |
|---|---|
| `wiki_query(question)` | Search the curated wiki pages. Start here. |
| `wiki_search(term, include_raw=true)` | Find literal text, also in raw session transcripts. Use when `wiki_query` finds nothing or you need exact wording. |
| `wiki_list_sources(project="<slug>")` | List the sessions of one project. The slug is usually the workspace folder name. |
| `wiki_read_page(path)` | Read one page in full. Paths come from the results above. |
| `wiki_entity_search`, `wiki_category_browse` | Browse by entity or tag. |
| `wiki_sync(confirm=true)` | Pull new sessions into the wiki. Dry run unless `confirm=true`; ask the user first. |

## How to answer

1. Search with `wiki_query`; fall back to `wiki_search` with `include_raw=true`.
2. Read the one or two most relevant pages with `wiki_read_page`.
3. Cite the page or session path you used, so the user can open it.
4. If nothing matches, say so and continue without the wiki. Do not invent past
   decisions.

If every tool returns an empty wiki, the folder set in the plugin config has no
`wiki/` yet: tell the user to run `sessionwiki sync` (and `sessionwiki synthesize`)
in that folder.
